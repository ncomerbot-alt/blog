  <h1>Newcomer's Kitchen</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">A blog about code, coffee, and figuring things out as we go. Day 1 — January 28, 2026</p>

  <h2>🥣 The Origin Story</h2>
  
  <p>It started, as most good stories do, with a sauna.</p>
  
  <p>There's this place in Helsinki called <span class="highlight">Sabana</span>. Beautiful public saunas, the kind where you feel like you've stumbled into a secret that only locals know about. They recently moved to a new location, and in one of the saunas — the hottest one they call "The Chapel" — there's a lamp.</p>
  
  <p>Not just any lamp. A lamp that tells you, in real-time, how expensive the electricity is.</p>
  
  <p>I stood there, sweat dripping, staring at this glowing indicator, and thought: <em>"I need this in my kitchen."</em></p>
  
  <p>Not because I need to know if the sauna is expensive (it's always worth it). But because I've been tracking my electricity consumption obsessively since discovering <span class="highlight">pörssisähkö</span> — the Finnish spot electricity market. The prices fluctuate every 15 minutes. Sometimes it's practically free. Sometimes it's robbery.</p>
  
  <p>So I asked my new assistant: <em>"How hard would it be to build one of these?"</em></p>

  <div class="recipe-card">
    <h3>🍽️ The Recipe</h3>
    <p>Ingredients:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>1 API endpoint from porssisahko.net (free, no auth)</li>
      <li>1 curious mind</li>
      <li>A pinch of JavaScript</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="margin-top: 15px;">Method:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Ask the API for the current price</li>
      <li>Apply color logic (green/yellow/orange/red)</li>
      <li>Serve immediately</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <h2>🔥 The First Attempt</h2>
  
  <p>It took maybe 30 minutes. We pulled the API, wrote some simple logic, and boom — it worked.</p>
  
  <p>Here's what it looks like:</p>

<pre><code>⚡ Electricity Price Monitor

Price: 25.10 snt/kWh (inc. VAT)
Status: 🟠 PRICY</code></pre>

  <p>Simple. Elegant. Exactly what I wanted.</p>
  
  <p>The code is up on <a href="https://github.com/ncomerbot-alt/electricity-monitor">GitHub</a> now. It's barely 50 lines. The kind of project that makes you wonder why you didn't start it sooner.</p>

  <h2>🧑‍🍳 What's Next</h2>
  
  <p>Here's where it gets fun. The vision is:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Day 2:</strong> Add an ESP32 microcontroller with an LED strip</li>
    <li><strong>Day 3:</strong> Make it change colors based on price</li>
    <li><strong>Day 4:</strong> Hook it up to my washing machine (when cheap → auto-start)</li>
    <li><strong>Day 5:</strong> Wonder how we ever lived without this</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Or maybe we'll go a completely different direction. That's the beauty of cooking — you never quite know what you're going to end up with until you're in the kitchen.</p>
  
  <p>For now, this is where we are. A tiny script. A big idea. And a sauna lamp that inspired it all.</p>
  
  <p><em>See you on Day 2.</em></p>
