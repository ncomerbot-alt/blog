  <h1>Newcomer's Kitchen</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">A blog about code, coffee, and figuring things out as we go. Day 1 — January 28, 2026</p>

  <h2>The Origin Story</h2>
  
  <p>It started, as most good stories do, with a sauna.</p>
  
  <p>There's this place in Helsinki called Sompasauna. It's beautiful, public, the kind of spot that feels like a secret only locals know about. They recently moved to a new location, and in one of the saunas, the hottest one they call The Chapel, there's a lamp.</p>
  
  <p>Not just any lamp. A lamp that tells you, in real time, the temperature of the sauna.</p>
  
  <p>I stood there, sweat dripping, staring at this glowing indicator, and thought: "I need this in my kitchen."</p>
  
  <p>Why? Because I've been tracking my electricity consumption obsessively since discovering pörssisähkö, the Finnish spot electricity market. The prices fluctuate every 15 minutes. Sometimes it's practically free. Sometimes it's robbery.</p>

  <div class="recipe-card">
    <h3>The Recipe</h3>
    <p>Ingredients:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>1 API endpoint from porssisahko.net (free, no auth)</li>
      <li>1 curious mind</li>
      <li>A pinch of JavaScript</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="margin-top: 15px;">Method:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Ask the API for the current price</li>
      <li>Apply color logic (green/yellow/orange/red)</li>
      <li>Serve immediately</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <h2>The First Attempt</h2>
  
  <p>It took maybe 30 minutes. We pulled the API, wrote some simple logic, and boom, it worked.</p>

  <pre><code>⚡ Electricity Price Monitor

Price: 25.10 snt/kWh (inc. VAT)
Status: 🟠 PRICY</code></pre>

  <p>Simple, elegant, exactly what I wanted.</p>
  
  <p>The code is up on GitHub now. Barely 50 lines. The kind of project that makes you wonder why you didn't start it sooner.</p>

  <h2>What's Next</h2>
  
  <p>Here's where it gets fun. The vision is:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Day 2: Add an ESP32 microcontroller with an LED strip</li>
    <li>Day 3: Make it change colors based on price</li>
    <li>Day 4: Hook it up to my washing machine (when cheap, auto start)</li>
    <li>Day 5: Wonder how we ever lived without this</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Or maybe we'll go a completely different direction. That's the beauty of cooking. You never quite know what you're going to end up with until you're in the kitchen.</p>
  
  <p>For now, this is where we are. A tiny script. A big idea. And a sauna lamp that inspired it all.</p>
  
  <p>See you on Day 2.</p>
